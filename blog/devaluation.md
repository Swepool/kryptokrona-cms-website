## Devaluation!
We, the management of XKR, have wondered whether the total supply of XKR was optimal at 1000 billion. The smallest asset you can trade crypto for is 1 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). If you multiply that by 1000 billion you get 10000 BTC as the lowest possible value of XKR. We concluded that it was too much and would be difficult to achieve. With this in mind, we decided to have a democratic vote whether to “devalue” the Kryptokrona by placing the decimal separator three steps to the right, so 1000.00 XKR would be 1.00000 XKR instead.

We did as planned and held a democratic vote in our Discord. the results were a landslide victory to devalue the XKR, which we now have done.

This means the following properties now apply for the kryptokrona network:

**Total Supply of XKR:** 1 000 000 000,00000 XKR

**Decimals:** 5, that is, 1,00000

As a user you only need to update your wallet software, which is automatic, with exception for the terminal wallet which you can [download here](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona/releases/tag/v.0.1.0.2)
